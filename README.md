1. Multivariate numbers.

 

 

 

1.1 The common concept about multivariate numbers.

 

Multivariate number of kind Аnaction f(t){xa ; ya ; za ; … ; Ran } represents object (a point, a piece, a rectangular …), formed of sequence of numbers f (t) by principle of an action (a sum, a multiplication), describing the given multivariate number. Value of multivariate number is a real number.

The n-dimensional number of a sum is designated Аnsumf(t){ xa ; ya ; za ; … ; Ran }[1]  or sumnf(t){ xa ; ya ; za ; … ; Ran }; the n-dimensional number of multiplication is designated Bnmulf(t){ xb; yb; zb; … ; Rbn}[2] or mulnf(t){ xb; yb; zb; … ; Rbn}, where

1.      A, B is a capital letter of the Latin alphabet for a designation in general multivariate number.

2.       n is the number of coordinates of multivariate number, is measurement of n-dimensional number, for example, Аnsum - n-dimensional number of a sum.

3.       sum, mul is an actions, principles of formation of multivariate number.

4.       f (t) is the function of formation of one-dimensional number from which the further multivariate numbers are formed, where t - a variable (if ranges of definition t and x coincide it is possible to write f (x)) .

5. {xa; ya; za; …; Ran}, {xb; yb; zb; …; Rbn } are coordinates of multivariate number (the whole consecutive numbers).

 

Number Аnmulf(t){xa; ya; za; …; Ran} is read: A - n-dimensional number of multiplication from function f (t), with coordinates x, y, z, …, Rn.

 

 

 

1.2 Formation of multivariate numbers.

 

Formation of multivariate numbers occurs according to formation of n-dimensional axes of Descartes i.e. distribution occurs in two opposite directions to perpendicularly previous distribution. In conditionally positive direction of distribution of number t in function f (t) undertake with "plus", in opposite - conditionally negative direction of distribution, number t undertake with "minus".

It is possible to make distribution and only in a positive direction.

Definition 1 (dimension of space on which there is a given multivariate number). The n-dimensional number exists on space on which first of last coordinates is more than unit, i.e.

An{xa;ya;za;…;Ran-n1>1;1;1…;1; Ran =1}=Bn-n1{xa;ya;za;…; Ran-n1}.

Consequence of definition 1. Value of number of n-dimensional space with last coordinate to equal unit coincides with value of number (n−1)-dimensional space with the same first coordinates as in the given number, only without last coordinate, i.e.

An{xa; ya; za; …; Ran =1}=Bn-1{xa; ya; za; …; Ran-1}.

Thus, number An{ xa ; ya ; za ; … ; Ran =1} is simultaneously and n-dimensional number and (n−1) … (n−n1)-dimensional number, but exists on space (n−n1), last coordinate on the given space is more than unit.

Definition 2 (n-dimensional number of a special case). We shall name n-dimensional number with last coordinate to equal unit n-dimensional number of a special case to designate, that its existence occurs on space below n-dimensional (as it is already told, such number exists on (n−n1)-dimensional space on which last coordinate of the given number is more than unit).

 

1.2.1 One-dimensional number.

One-dimensional number А1 represents a number - point with one coordinate {x}. The point is formed functionally А1{x}=f(t) where a variable, at concurrence of ranges of definition of variables x and t, is x (coordinate of one-dimensional number).

Table 2.

 

One-dimensional number А1 {x} is a special case of bidimentional number А2 {x; 1} and their values coincide (as bidimentional number А2 {x; 1} exists on one-dimensional space А1 {x} (look definition 1)). The sequence of one-dimensional numbers (points) is a straight line - sequence of bidimentional numbers, with the second coordinate to equal unit.

By definition 1:

 

                  A1f(x){x} = f(x) = A2f(x){x;1}                 , (at t=x) the formula 1.

 

Definition 3 (Formation of n-dimensional number) for number of the n-dimensional space which is not being n-dimensional number of a special case, i.e. for number which last coordinate is more than unit (for n-dimensional number of a special case it is necessary to find dimension of space in which it is not number of a special case and then to apply this definition).N-dimensional number An with coordinates {xa; ya; za; …; Ran} represents action (a sum, a multiplication) of n-dimensional numbers on (n-1) the-dimensional space[3] limited to the beginning of coordinates and coordinates xa; ya; za; …; Ran-1  at the constant last coordinate equal Rn=Ran−1=const. I.e., number An represents action of exhaustive search of all n-dimensional numbers with coordinates {x[0;xa] ; y[]0;ya]; z[0;za]; …; Rn-1[0;Ran-1]; Rn = Ran−1}, notice - last coordinate is constant!

For example:

a)                sum2f(t){x;y}=.

b)                mul2 f(t){x;y}=(mul2 f(t){i;y-1})[4].

 

1.2.2 Bidimentional number.

Bidimentional number A2 {x; y} represents number - straight line with two coordinates {x; y}. At y=1 number A2 is a straight line of one-dimensional numbers, at y [2; ) number A2 is a straight line of the bidimentional numbers formed from a straight line of bidimentional numbers with the second coordinate equal (y-1). Formation occurs by a principle of the action describing the given multivariate number. Value of this number is the action (a sum, a multiplication) values of numbers of this straight line.

 

1.2.3 Three-dimensional number.

Three-dimensional number A3{xa; ya; za} represents a number - plane with three coordinates, made at za=1 from bidimentional numbers, and at za[2; ) from three-dimensional numbers with the third coordinate equal (za−1). Value of this number is the action (a sum, a multiplication) values of numbers of this plane.

 

1.2.4 N-dimensional number.

The N-dimensional number is analogy of the numbers described above.

 

For presentation, multivariate numbers should be presented as values of the given n-dimensional numbers on n-dimensional Cartesian space, as points with the coordinates corresponding to coordinates of the given multivariate number.

 

1.3 Function of multivariate number.

 

Function of multivariate number is the regularity, allowing expressing values of n-dimensional number through coordinates of this number. This function enters the name f (x; y; z; …; Rn) actionnf (t), where

1.       x, y, z..., Rn - constant or independent variables which are coordinates of n-dimensional number.

2.       n - the common number of coordinates, the order of measurement of multivariate number.

3.       f (t) - function of formation of one-dimensional number.

Function f (x; y; z; …; Rn) sumnf (t) it is read: function of a sum of n-dimensional numbers from function f (t) with variables x, y …; with constants Ra=C1, Rb=C2, ….

So, function f(xa; ya; za; …; Ran)действиеn f(t)= Rn+1,

where Rn+1 the dependent variable being value of n-dimensional number An. For example:

а) See the formula 5.1 - function of bidimentional number of a sum from unit.

б) f (x; 2) mul2N(t) =x! - function of multiplication of bidimentional numbers from sequence of natural numbers (the function known in theory of probabilities as a n-factorial).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. Multivariate numbers of a sum from constant number C=1.

 

 

 

2.1 Formation of multivariate numbers of a sum from unit.

 

According to definition 3, multivariate number of a sum from unit Ansum1{xa; ya; za; …; Ran} represents the sum of n-dimensional numbers on  the (n−1)-dimensional space limited to the beginning of coordinates and coordinates xa , ya , za, …, Ran-1, at Rn= Ran−1. We shall agree to count the sum of n-dimensional numbers at an exhaustive search of the coordinates accepting values from 1 up to , instead of from 0 up to  - i.e. Rn[1;)[5]. Mathematically definition 3 will be written down:

                                                            

   sumn1{x;y;z;…;Rn}=     formula 2[6].

 

 

 

 

2.2 Values of Multivariate numbers of a sum from unit.

 

2.2.1 sum11 {x}.

Let's find values of one-dimensional numbers of a sum from unit.

By definition, the one-dimensional number is value of function f (t), but f (t) in this case this constant number C=1, therefore A1sum1{x} =1 at anyone x.

 

2.2.2 sum21 {x; y}.

Values of bidimentional numbers of the sum from unit of a special case coincide with values of one-dimensional numbers. Therefore

 

   A2sum1{x;1}= A1sum1{x}=1                                                          formula 3.1

    

Straight line (x; 1) in the appendix 1 there are values of bidimentional numbers of a special case.

 

Condition on the order of n-dimensional number. There are n-dimensional numbers with coordinates {x;y;…;Rn-1;Rn=const} where last coordinate is constant, we shall agree to name such numbers n-dimensional numbers Rn=const of the order, for example:

a)       sum21 {x; 2} - bidimentional number of a sum from unit of the second order.

b)       mul2N (t) {x; 2} - bidimentional number of multiplication from sequence of natural numbers of the second order.

 

Condition of brief record. We shall agree for simplicity to designate n-dimensional number of a sum from unit only in its coordinates in braces, i.e. Ansum1{xa;ya;za;…;Ran}={xa;ya;za;…;Ran}.

Values of bidimentional numbers of a sum from unit at y> 1 we shall find under the formula 2:

{x;y}={1;y-1} + {2;y-1} + … + {x-1;y-1} + {x;y-1}.

So for y=2

{x;2}=, but sum21{x;1}=1, then

 

       {x;2}==x                                                                                      formula 3.2

 

For  y=3

{x;3}=, but sum21{x;2}=x, then

       {x;3}== 1+2+3+…+x                                                                    formula 3.3

 

For y=4

{x;4}= = {1;3} + {2;3} + … + {x-1;3} + {x;3}, but sum21{x;3}=, then

    {x;4}=                                                                                    formula 3.4

 

And for anyone y

 

     {x;y}=                                                                                      formula 3.y

 

Values for {x; y} there are straight lines {x; y=const} in the appendix 1.

 

2.2.3 sum31 {x; y; z}.

Values of numbers {x; y; 1} a special case coincide with values {x; y}, then

 

    {x;y;1}=                                                                               formula 4.1

 

Under the formula 2 we find values of other three-dimensional numbers of the sum from unit

 

                                                                                                                                                                                                         

 

formula 4.z

 

 

2.2.4 sumn1{x;y;z;…;Rn}.

Values of more complex n-dimensional numbers it is calculated similarly[7].

 

 

2.3 Functions of Multivariate numbers of a sum from unit.

 

Calculation of values of n-dimensional numbers of a sum from unit under the formula 2 is too bulky. But there are the regularities, allowing to calculate values of some multivariate numbers of a sum from unit through their coordinates.

 

2.3.1 f(x;y)sum21.

The function, allowing to express values of bidimentional numbers of a sum from unit through its coordinates, looks like:

 

                              f{x;y}sum2(C=1)= ,

function is valid for    ;

at       f{x;y}sum21=0 , at       f{x;y}sum21=1,

 

I.e., if a point with coordinates of bidimentional number {x; y} is on one of numerical axes value of this number is equal to zero (exception {0;1}=1[8]):

{0;y≠1}=0,

{x;0}=0.

 

 

So, any bidimentional number {x; y} with coordinates x> 0, y> 0, y≠1 it is possible to find under the formula:

 

     A2sum1{xa;ya}=      ,                                                formula 5.1

 

Where xa, ya - coordinates of bidimentional number A2sum1.

 

The formula 5.1 for  can be presented as

A2sum1{xa;ya}=                                     formula 5.2

 

The schedule of function f {x; y} sum2 (C=1). Values of function z=  are integers - separate points on space of the Cartesian coordinate axes if to connect these points among themselves we shall receive a surface which is a spiral twisting on an axis 0Y on 90º from plane X0Y in infinity (see schedule 1).



Schedule 1. A spiral z = {x; y}

 

2.3.2 f (x; y; z) sum31.

The way of decomposition of sequence on summands[9] we shall find regularity between values of three-dimensional numbers of a sum from unit from its coordinates (expressed through bidimentional numbers).

 

 {x;y;z}=                                                                                                 

 

                                                                                                                   formula 6.[10]

 

The schedule of function R4 = {x; y; z} is rotating around of an axis 0Y a spiral z = {x; y} with simultaneous, respective to rotation, extension of a petal of this spiral (extension of forming z={x;i[1;y]}).

 

 

2.4 Symmetry of values of n-dimensional numbers of a sum from unit.

 

Values of n-dimensional numbers of a sum from unit, located on the Cartesian space as points (coordinates of points coincide with coordinates of n-dimensional number) are symmetric concerning a straight line, a plane, a cube … with coordinates (x=y; y=x; z; …; Rn), i.e. value of number Ansum1 with coordinates { xa; ya; za; …; Ran } is equal to value of number Bnsum1 with coordinates {ya; xa; za; …; Ran }.

 

   sumn1{ xa; ya; za; …; Ran }=sumn1{ya; xa; za; …; Ran }                        formula 7[11].

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Application of Multivariate numbers of a sum from unit.

 

 

 

3.1 Life[12].

 

{x; 1} - there is a point, unit of something, the base of mathematics[13].

{x; 2} - there is a sum of units of something, represents calculation of quantity. It is initial, fundamental action in mathematics[14].

 

3.2 Theory of probabilities.

 

a) {x; y} - there is a combination (x+y-2) elements on (x-1) the elements differing though one element, i.e.

{x;y}=     или  ={n-m+1;m+1}

b) Regularities, actions with the multivariate numbers, facilitating calculations:

1. By definition of multivariate number

5. Disclosing complex function



 

3.3 Mathematics.

 

The way of decomposition of sequence on summands.

The sum of bidimentional numbers {x; y}, everyone increased on constant number, is function of a kind a1xn+ a2xn-1+…+ an+1x0=f(x) [1][15], and as bidimentional number {x; y} there is a sum of the sum, the sum, …, the sum of units it is possible to find regularities (function) for some only decreasing or only  growing sequences described by function of a kind [1],  representing a sums of the sum, of the sum, …, of the sum of units. We shall name such sequences - sequences of the bidimentional sum.

Let's consider an example of a finding of regularity for sequence of values of factor of the fifth member of function x(x+1)(x+2)…(x+(a-1))(x+a)=f(x) [2]. The fifth member after disclosing brackets looks like kpxp, where p=a−3. Let's make the table of values of factor kp depending on a degree p a variable x.

We have growing sequence. We shall find dependence between value of factor kp and a degree p of a variable x.

Let's make the table of members of sequence and differences of two next members of this sequence, and a difference we shall write down under the bigger number. We shall name a line of differences the level, and a line of sequence the maximum level. We shall designate each difference in coordinates (p; Ln): the first coordinate p - a degree of a variable x and number of the column, the second coordinate Ln - number of a level. We shall find differences of the next numbers for all levels (in the table the difference is allocated by color). At low enough level we shall reach a line consisting of zero. Let this level will be zero level, the next higher line will be the first level, and so on up to a maximum level.

Or

 

                

                                                                                                                          

 

The formula 10.2

 

For number of a maximum level (sequence) the formula 10.2 will be written down

 

                                    

 

The formula 10.3[17]

 

So, we have received the formula for a finding of any member of the growing sequence expressed through numbers of the column of a minimum[18].

For simplification of calculations the column of a minimum should be chosen with the minimal numbers, with a plenty of zero or with identical numbers. It is visible, that the minimal numbers (table 4) are in columns with numbers close to zero. To fill such columns, it is necessary to continue a zero level to the left and under the formula 8 to find numbers of other levels (in table 4 such numbers on a transparent background).

Now we shall return to a finding of regularity for sequence of table 4.

We have growing sequence, its function we shall find under the formula 10.3, but all over again we shall choose a column of a minimum. Most of all approach a column p=0 (a) (a plenty of zero) and p=1 (b) (many identical numbers). We shall substitute numbers of the give columns and value of maximum level Lnmax=9 in the formula 10.3:

 

 

 

a)   

 

b)  

Resulting in standard record, we shall receive the equation of a kind [1] eighth order[19]

 



 

 

 

Let's consider necessary and sufficient conditions that the sequence was sequence of the bidimentional sum.

Sufficient conditions:

a)       If function of sequence looks like a1xn+ a2xn-1+…+ an+1x0=f(x) the given sequence is sequence of the bidimentional sum[20].

b)       If the sequence is decomposed up to zero[21] the given sequence is sequence of the bidimentional sum.

Necessary conditions:

a)  If the sequence is characterized by the formula

 



 [22],

 

that this sequence can be sequence of the bidimentional sum.

b) ???

 

3.4 Multivariate figures.

 

Calculation of quantity of connections in multivariate figures.

For example, quantity of connections in a n-dimensional parallelepiped equally

 

,

 

And the quantity of connections in a n-dimensional pyramid is equal

 

,

 

where n - dimension of a figure,

p - a kind of connections:

p=0 - connection - a point,

p=1 - connection - a straight line,

p=2 - connection − a plane,

and so on.

[1] - Sum.

[2] - Multiplication.

[3] For example, at n =2 action is made on one-dimensional space - a piece, at n=3 - in a rectangular, at n=4 - in a parallelepiped and so on

[4] By analogy to the formula n! - multiplication of sequence of natural numbers.

 

[5] As at any of coordinates of multivariate number of a sum from unit equal to zero, value of this number is equal to zero (exception {0; 1; …; 1} =1, look a footnote 8).

[6] Incorrect record of the sum.

[7] Probably it is more convenient to present calculation of multivariate numbers how it is shown in the appendix 3.

[8]  As {0; 1} there is a bidimentional number of a special case or one-dimensional number, and value of one-dimensional number is function f (t), in this case f (t) =1.

 

[9] About the way of decomposition of sequence on summands read in section 3 “Appendix of Multivariate numbers of a sum from unit”.

[10] The formula 6 is evidently submitted in the appendix 4.

[11] Exception number {0; 1; 1; …; 1} =1 (look a footnote 8).

[12] Pathos.

[13] Certainly, not number {x;1} is a prototype of unit, and on the contrary.

[14] Certainly, not number {x; y} is a prototype of the sum, and the sum is action due to which the given number is formed.

[15] Look the appendix 5.

[16] Numbers 1, 2, 3 … it was necessary to present as the sum of units 1, 1+1, 1+1+1 …

[17] This formula is for growing sequence. For decreasing sequence the first coordinate in bidimentional numbers is not (p-pmin), and this one (pmin-p), that is the formula for calculation of numbers of decreasing sequence will be written down


formula 10.4

 

[18] If we have found the formula not through a degree p a variable x, and through a variable a the sense would not be lost since value of a variable p or a, and a difference about a column of required number with the order of a column of a minimum is important not, and this difference for any variables is equal

r=p-pmin=a-amin,

that is numbering has no value
